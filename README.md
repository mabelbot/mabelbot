### Hello World

- I just finished working on an event management software built with Spring Boot and HomeAid (backend) with @DinhJDev and 1 other. Also working on version 5 of an automatic-vending Discord bot (python with Flask web application).
- I’m currently expanding Spring Boot + Java expertise, Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java, learning intermediate React and more about NLP Sequence Models 
- I’m looking to collaborate on any open source Python or Java projects involving cloud/distributed computing, NLP, or fun algorithms. I love making innovative and useful solutions to problems that currently involve lots of manual work. I also am fluent in a variety of other programming languages (such as Javascript) and can pick up new technologies quickly.
